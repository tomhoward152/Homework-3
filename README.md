## Description
In this project I was tasked with building a tool to generate a random password for someone based on criteria input by the user.


## Takeaways
This project showed how important it is to think of all solutions/inputs and safeguard from any way the user may break it. One thing I noticed is that sometimes the prompts will re-appear and I could not figure out why. Any input on why that is occuring is more than welcome.
